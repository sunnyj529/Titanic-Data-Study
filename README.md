# Titanic-Data-Study

## Background
- Used Python to explore Titanic passenger data
- Analyzed passenger survival rate factors like age, gender and P Class
- Used Jupyter to document the thinking process and findings

## Findings
- **Age: The 0-10 age range has highest surival rate at 59%.** The next highest age range is 30-40 at 45%.
- **Gender: The female survival rate across all age ranges are higher than 60%.** While for male, except for 0-10 age range, other ranges' survival rate are lower than 25%! This suggests that most men gave up their opportunity for life to children and women.
- **P Class: The 1st class has the highest survival rate at 63%.** while it drops to 47% and 24% for second and third class. This suggests the higher the ticket class the better chance passangers survived.
